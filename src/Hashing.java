//    HashSet: is a collection in Java that stores unique elements. It implements the Set interface and uses a hash
//             table for storage. HashSets do not maintain the order of the elements and allow null values.
//
//             In a HashSet, elements are stored based on their hash code value, which allows for constant-time
//             performance for basic operations such as add, remove, and contains. HashSets also offer O(1) time
//             complexity for these operations on average, although this can vary depending on the distribution of hash codes.
